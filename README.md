# Additive Manufacturing Research
This repo uses data supplied by the air force reseach lab to train a multi input Convolutional Neural Network
The full dataset can be found at https://materials-data-facility.github.io/MID3AS-AM-Challenge/ under Challenge 3, file size 
restricts the amount of data found in this repo. Research conducted under Dr. Som Dutta at Utah State University.

## Parts  
This repo has several folders containing different parts of the research
<br>
<br>
### Original Data
Contains some of the original data (whatever could be uploaded due to file limitations).
<br>
<br>
### Scripts
Contains two types of python scripts used in this project.
##### Data Cleaning
These scripts allow the original data to be split, allowing for more training data to be used in the model.
##### Network
This contains the Neural Network that is to be trained on the train data.
<br>
<br>
### Test
This contains 10% of the data to test the results of the neural network.
<br>
<br>
### Train 
This contains 90% of the data to train and validate the neural network.
