# Additive Manufacturing Research
This repo uses data supplied by the air force reseach lab to train a multi input Convolutional Neural Network
The full dataset can be found at https://materials-data-facility.github.io/MID3AS-AM-Challenge/ under Challenge 3, file size 
restricts the amount of data found in this repo. Research conducted under Dr. Som Dutta at Utah State University.

### Scripts
Contains two types of python scripts used in this project.
##### Data Cleaning
These scripts allow the original data to be split, creating a more robust dataset that is able to be trained in the model
##### Network
This contains the Neural Network that is to be trained on the train data.
